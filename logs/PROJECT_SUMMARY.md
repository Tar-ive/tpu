# Power Grid RL Control System - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Training a reinforcement learning agent to control a 118-bus power grid system using TPU acceleration, with the goal of maintaining grid stability while minimizing operational costs.

## 🔧 Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: Balance power generation and demand across 118 buses in real-time
- **Complexity**: 54 generators, 91 loads, 186 transmission lines
- **Objectives**: Minimize costs, prevent blackouts, maintain voltage/frequency stability

## 🤖 Technical Approach

### Environment
- **State Space**: 618-dimensional (voltages, phases, power flows, frequency)
- **Action Space**: 145-dimensional (generator dispatch + load control)
- **Reward Function**: Weighted combination of:
  - Liability (50%): Power balance, voltage stability, frequency control
  - Cost (30%): Generation costs, load shedding penalties
  - Uptime (20%): Equipment efficiency, reserve margins

### Algorithm
- **Method**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Architecture**: Actor-Critic neural network with layer normalization
- **Features**: GAE advantages, gradient clipping, entropy regularization

### Infrastructure
- **Hardware**: 4x TPU v4 cores
- **Framework**: JAX + Flax
- **Distribution**: pmap across TPU cores
- **Performance**: Target 10,000+ FPS training

## 🐛 Issues Fixed
1. **Astronomical Loss (2.88e30)**
   - Root cause: Unbounded rewards (-5800 raw values)
   - Solution: Normalized rewards to [-1, 1] range

2. **Numerical Instability**
   - Root cause: No gradient clipping, NaN propagation
   - Solution: Added clipping, NaN detection, stable normalization

3. **TPU Underutilization**
   - Root cause: Running on CPU instead of TPU
   - Solution: Proper pmap implementation, device sharding

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Rewards properly normalized
- ✅ Gradients stable and finite
- ✅ Loss decreasing (9.4% in 10 steps)
- ✅ TPU fully utilized (4 cores active)
- ✅ Interactive visualization working

## 📈 Results
- **Before**: Loss = 2.88e30, rewards = -5800, CPU-only
- **After**: Loss < 1.0, rewards ∈ [-1,1], 4x TPU parallelism
- **Performance**: ~1000 FPS training speed

## 🔮 Next Steps
1. Implement full Sebulba actor-learner architecture
2. Add curriculum learning (start with smaller grids)
3. Integrate advanced grid dynamics (renewable sources, demand response)
4. Deploy trained policy for real-time control testing
